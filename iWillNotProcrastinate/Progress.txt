Accomplishments: Set up basic application logic today: basic SubjectsListTableViewController

==Tuesday, May 10 ===
Goals:  - put SubjectsListTableViwController in a UINavigationController
        - set up a 'plus' button to add a new subject to the TableView and Core Data Database
            - throw error to user if the subject already exists and has been created in the past
        - set up a new view controller that will be pushed after user has tapped on a subject
            -*Will later implement this view controller.  For now just have it display a random UIButton that says back. (for testing use only)

Accomplishments:

Currently working/need to work on: 
May 10 11:53am
fix up everything that needs to be pass along through SubjectsListTableViewController
SubjectsListDetailViewController
TimeEventsTableViewController

current was working on the list between SubjectsListTableViewController and SubjectsListDetailViewController
Do the initWithNibName:bundle:subject method stuff
I Used the performFetch:error: method in order to return an array containing the Subject.  We can then pass this to
SubjectsListDetailViewController which will then pass it on to TimeEventsTableViewController.
Note: TimeEventsTableViewController will NOT be pushed onto the stack (UINavigationController) it will be 
a subview of SubjectsListDetailViewController.  It does need to have a Subject object passed to it though obviously.
